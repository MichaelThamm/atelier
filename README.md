# Atelier

![Atelier](docs/images/atelier.png)

A provider-agnostic terminal UI for configuring Terraform modules.

Atelier works with **any** Terraform provider — AWS, GCP, Azure, Juju, or
anything else with a Terraform provider. It treats a module's variables as
its API surface. The wrapper it generates captures only the values the
deployer chose to set, so `main.tf` reads as a concise statement of intent
rather than a wall of options. Defaults handle the rest, and plan diffs show exactly what changes between versions — making large modules approachable for first-time and experienced Terraform users alike.

## Quick start

```bash
# Any public git repo containing Terraform modules works:
atelier init https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc.git
atelier init https://github.com/canonical/observability-stack.git

# Already have a Terraform project with a module block? Adopt it:
cd my-existing-terraform-project/
atelier init

# Re-open an existing wrapper:
atelier
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `Tab` | Anywhere | Switch between left (variable list) and right (editor) pane |
| `↑` / `↓` | Left pane | Navigate variables |
| `Enter` | Left pane | Focus the editor for the selected variable |
| `P` | Left pane | Run `terraform plan` against the wrapper |
| `A` | Plan view | Apply the current plan |
| `O` | Plan view | Show terraform outputs (planned values or state) |
| `R` | Left pane | Switch the module ref (branch, tag, or SHA) |
| `E` | Left pane | Show full error detail (when an error is present) |
| `F` | Left pane | Open the preset picker (when presets are available) |
| `?` | Anywhere | Show the keyboard shortcuts help modal |
| `^R` | Anywhere | Reset the current variable to its default |
| `Q` | Left pane | Quit and save |

### Output view

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Scroll down |
| `k` / `↑` | Scroll up |
| `Ctrl+D` / `PgDn` | Half-page down |
| `Ctrl+U` / `PgUp` | Half-page up |
| `g` | Jump to top |
| `G` | Jump to bottom |
| `Esc` / `q` | Close |

## Presets

Module maintainers can declare **presets** in `atelier.yaml` — named bundles
of variable values that users apply in one action, then customise as needed.

```yaml
modules:
  - path: terraform/cos-lite
    name: "COS Lite"
    presets:
      - name: production
        description: "Stable channel, TLS, HA replicas."
        sets:
          risk: "stable"
          internal_tls: true
          alertmanager:
            units: 3
```

When presets are declared, `[F] preset` appears in the status bar. Press `F`
to open the picker, navigate with `↑`/`↓`, apply with `Enter`, or cancel
with `Esc`.

See [docs/examples/cos-lite.atelier.yaml](docs/examples/cos-lite.atelier.yaml)
for a full example.

## Comparing versions

Press `R` to switch the module ref without leaving the TUI. Atelier
re-clones the module, carries your values forward, runs
`terraform init -upgrade`, and flags any orphaned or newly required
variables.

1. Configure and plan at `v1.0`.
2. Press `R`, type `v2.0`, confirm.
3. Plan again — the diff shows what the version bump changes.

## Validate on save

Every time you edit a variable, Atelier debounces a background
`terraform validate`. Errors appear inline in the status bar; press `E` to
see full diagnostics. Validation runs `terraform init` automatically if the
workspace hasn't been initialised yet.

## Outputs

Press `O` in plan view to inspect module outputs. Before apply, Atelier
shows the planned output values from the plan file. After apply, it fetches
live values from state. The output view is scrollable — use `j`/`k` or
`PgUp`/`PgDn` to navigate large outputs.

Atelier generates an `outputs.tf` in the wrapper that forwards all of the
module's declared outputs:

```hcl
output "offers" {
  value = module.cos_lite.offers
}
```
